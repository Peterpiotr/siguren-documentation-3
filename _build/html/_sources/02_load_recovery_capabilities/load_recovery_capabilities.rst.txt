Using the MS load recovery capabilities
=======================================

The MS will never allow a load drop. It will arrest the hoist drum whenever 
the hoist brake is unable to do so. However, the MS can be used as a 
gearbox to lower and even raise the load. Notе that the MS is irreversible 
– meaning that load drop is impossible even when the MS alone is used for 
recovering the load. This allows the user to use the weight of the load 
without fearing a load drop.

This said, three main methods can be used (and combined) to recover 
the load, depending on how the hoist brake and the MS can be accessed and 
used in the emergency situation that requires the recovery.


Forced MS recovery
------------------

With the brake open and the MS holding the load, rotate the MS worm shaft 
with considerable torque. In this situation the MS moves the load.
This way, a very high amount of torque must be applied on the MS shaft 
(approximately 1/8 of the barrel torque).

Using the following hardware:

- Portable Recovery Tool for sizes MS4 - MS7, or
- Handheld Recovery Tool for sizes MS0 - MS3

For MS with Integrated Remote Recovery the hardware is integrated and is 
remotely operated.

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-	Open the Brake
-	Rotate the Worm Shaft with the following torque to lower the SWL (maximum values)

Indicative barrel speed: 0.1 - 0.3 rpm


MS followed gravity lowering
-----------------------------

Step lowering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method can be used only with Hydraulic Damping MS

Pulse the brake (manually or electrically) to lower the load a few 
centimeters. The MS worm will shift toward the damping chamber. The 
electrical or brake lever pulse must be short enough to not allow the 
worm to reach the elastomer at the bottom of the damping chamber. Then it 
is possible to return the worm shaft to its “centered” position by hand. 

Repeat this until the load reaches the floor.

This way, very low torque applied on the MS shaft will be needed 
(approximately 1/5000 of the barrel torque). Using handwheel / crank 
handle or standard ratchet handle.

The MS can automatically follow if switched to Backup Mode. This negates 
the need of manual operation at the worm shaft. In case of power outage, 
the MS can be UPS/battery operated.
Furthermore, the MS can control the brake opening / closing, thus making 
the gravity load recovery automated.

-	Pulse the Brake to achieve less than 30 degrees barrel rotation by gravity
-	Rotate the Worm Shaft by hand few rotations to centralize it
-	Repeat

Indicative mean barrel speed: 0.5 rpm


Backup Mode gravity lowering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Switch the MS to Backup Mode and demand lowering. Progressively release the motor brake using the provided Brake Release Tool, until the load starts to rotate the barrel. Use the tool to regulate and maintain the speed below the specified safe speed. A buzzer will sound when the safe speed is close.

The MS will arrest the barrel if:

-	lowering order is removed or
-	overspeed is reached

After such arrest, the worm shaft can be returned to its “centered” position 
by using a standard wrench.

In case of power outage, the MS can be UPS/battery operated.

Indicative barrel speed: 2 - 5 rpm


MS assisted gravity lowering
----------------------------

Apply moderate torque to the MS shaft. Progressively release the motor 
brake, using the provided Brake Release Tool, until the load starts to 
rotate the barrel. The barrel stops when no torque is applied to the MS 
shaft.

In this scenario, only moderate torque is to be applied to the MS shaft 
(approximately 1/250 of the barrel torque).

Using the following hardware:

- Handheld Recovery Tool for MS sizes above MS4
- handwheel / crank handle or standard ratchet handle for sizes MS0 – MS3

-	Apply moderate torque to the MS shaft, using the appropriate method,
-	Progressively release the motor brake, using the provided Brake Release Tool, until the load starts to rotate the barrel (as long as moderate torque is applied to the MS shaft)
-	Rotate the MS worm shaft to lower the load. Use the Brake Release Tool to maintain the torque to be applied to on the worm shaft inside the specified limits
